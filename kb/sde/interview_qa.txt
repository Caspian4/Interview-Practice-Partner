A. General Software Engineering Interview Questions
Question: What is software engineering?
Answer:

Software engineering is a systematic approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It combines principles from engineering and computer science to ensure that software is reliable, scalable, and maintainable. It involves processes like requirements analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance. The goal is to manage complexity and deliver high-quality software within time, cost, and resource constraints.

Follow-up Questions:

Why is software engineering needed in modern development?

How does software engineering differ from traditional programming?

What are some challenges faced in large software engineering projects?

Question: What are the key phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?
Answer:

The key phases include:
Requirement Gathering → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance.
Each phase ensures the product is reliable and aligned with user needs.

Which SDLC model have you worked with?

How do Agile and Waterfall handle SDLC phases differently?

Which SDLC phase do you personally find most challenging and why?

Question: What are RESTful APIs and how do they work?
RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer):
RESTful APIs are architectural style APIs that use HTTP requests to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
They are based on a client-server model, where clients initiate requests (HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources hosted on a server.

Follow-up Questions:

How is REST different from GraphQL?

What are HTTP idempotent methods?

What is stateless communication?

Question: What is polymorphism?
Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or exhibit different behaviors depending on their context or the messages they receive. It allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface.
Implementation: Polymorphism can be implemented in programming languages through method overriding and method overloading.
Method Overriding: In method overriding, a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows objects of the subclass to invoke the overridden method through a common interface.
Method Overloading: In method overloading, multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists are defined within a class. The appropriate method is selected based on the number and types of arguments passed to it, enabling the same method name to be used for different behaviors.

Follow-up Questions:

What is the difference between overriding and overloading?

Can constructors be overloaded?

Give an example of runtime polymorphism.

Question: What is inheritance and why is it useful?
Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). The subclass can extend or modify the behavior of the superclass while inheriting its common characteristics.
Benefits:
Code Reuse, Modularity

Follow-up Questions:

When should inheritance NOT be used?

What is composition vs inheritance?

Provide an example of an inheritance hierarchy.

Question: Abstract class vs interface?

Abstract Class: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation). It serves as a blueprint for subclasses to inherit attributes and methods while providing common behavior. Subclasses must implement abstract methods to become concrete classes.
Interface: An interface is a contract that defines a set of method signatures without specifying their implementations. It defines a protocol for communication between classes by declaring the methods they must implement. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces cannot contain concrete methods or instance variables.

Follow-up Questions:

When would you choose an interface over an abstract class?

Can a class implement multiple interfaces?

Explain default methods in interfaces.

N. Soft Skills
Question: Describe working in a cross-functional team.
In one of my previous projects, I worked closely with the marketing and design teams to build a customer-facing web portal. The marketing team provided insights into customer behavior and user personas, while the design team focused on creating an intuitive user interface. 

My role as a software developer was to translate their inputs into a functional and scalable system. We used Agile methodologies, and regular communication was key. Through daily stand-ups and feedback loops, we aligned on priorities and successfully launched the portal ahead of schedule, with positive user feedback.


Follow-up Questions:

Question: How do you prioritize tasks?
When I have multiple deadlines, I first assess the urgency and importance of each task. I use tools like the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks based on their impact and time sensitivity. I break larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and set milestones for each. 

By communicating with stakeholders, I ensure that I’m aligned with the project’s priorities. I also make use of project management tools like Jira to track progress and re-adjust priorities as needed. Staying organized and focused helps me deliver quality work on time, even when faced with competing deadlines.
